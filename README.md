# Project 10K #
By: Thomas Mitrevski, Paul Gill, Yvette Ly and Racim Badsi

## Proposal ##
- Through sentiment analysis, investors can quickly understand if the tone of annual (10K) and quarterly (10Q) are positive, negative, or litigious etc. The overall sentiment expressed in these reports can then be used to help investors decide if they should invest in a company.
- On the other hand, many would argue that nothing beats the numbers, and many investors would prefer to look at a company’s financials before they invest.

## Story: ##
Our client wants to know if he should focus on the financials or the sentiment of the reports or both?

## Hypothesis ##
- Is it possible, using sentiment analysis, to predict revenue increases or decreases of certain stocks using a company’s financial reports from the last 10 years?
- OR is a Time Series Analysis of financial statements (balance sheets, income statements) a better predictor?


### Time Series Analysis from the Financial Statements ###
    This particular repository presents the time series analysis part of the project.

    We want to look at the contents of 10-K and 10-Q statements to determine if the contents of the Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Statement of Cash Flows will predict a shift in the prices on the dates the statements are published.

    If we can show that the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) contained in the Financial Statements affect the price in a fashion different from the normal price movement, we  may be able to take advantage of that in an algorithmic trading signal in the future.
